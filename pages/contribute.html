	<h2>How can I help?</h2>
	<p>
		This site is being hosted directly through Github pages, so any changes made to the master branch will be immediately shown on the site. Using Github for a project like this makes collaborating a lot easier
	</p>

	<p>
		Any help at all is appreciated, though I still have final say on what makes it on to the site. I will comment on any pull requests that I think need changes before they can be merged into the master branch. While this site hosts information on a wide range of topics I would like to keep the general formatting the same across all articles. I'll be providing a general formatting guide for this site as soon as possible. Pages will only be approved if they follow this guide.
