    <h2>Guides</h2>
    <p>These pages aim to teach a specific technique or how to fix a certain problem. They'll be split up into steps to keep guides concise and easy to follow. Each guide shouldn't take more than about 5 mins to read through and should be fairly self contained, only teaching what is needed for that guide.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>These pages will act as an index for noteworthy content, usually linking to pages off site. An example would be a page that lists all of the most useful Blender addons. Lists can consist of anything, such as a list of addons, websites, or programs.</p>
